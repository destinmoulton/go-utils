# go-utils

A set of utilities written in Go.

A shared lib package allows the utilities to send messages via dbus, take a screenshot, perform basic image comparison, and many other useful things.

## Dropbox Keepalive (dropbox-keepalive)

Dropbox has a few gui bugs in i3. I don't know if they are related to i3 or dropbox or the systray, but the Dropbox systray icon sometimes disappears after resuming from sleep/hibernation. Sometimes the systray icon loads in the upper left of the screen.

Checks whether `dropbox` process is running.
